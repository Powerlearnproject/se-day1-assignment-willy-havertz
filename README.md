Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

(A)Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality Software systems.
-Importance in the technology industry ->Almost all aspects of our lives are controlled by software's. From government portals, school's systems, health systems, entertainment and personal systems.We rely heavily on mobile phones and computers. Software Engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power these aspects of modern life.

(B)Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-1970s and 1980s: Introduction of structured programming and object-oriented development.
-1990s and 2000s: Agile methods, web-based systems, and open-source software became widespread.
-Recent Trends: Cloud computing, AI integration, and DevOps emphasize continuous delivery and scalability.

(C)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 1. Requirements - Gathering and documenting user and system requirements.
 2. Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
 3. Implementation - Writing code and building the software  according to all the design and specifications.
 4. Testing - Conducting test to ensure the software or system meets quality standards and functional requirements.
 5. Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
 6  Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.

(D)Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing ownwards like a waterfall. Waterfall model was used to develop enterprse applications like Customer Relationship Systems(CRM) systems, Supply Chain Management Systems and Inventory Management Systems.
-Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.  e.g Adobe woking on a project to come with competing product for Microsoft Word.

(E)Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing sofware solutions.
-Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

(F)Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-Intergrated Development Environment: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, dubugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio Code, eclipse
-Version Control System Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, sub version.


(G)What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Increasing Complexity: Modern systems require more functionality and faster delivery.

-Changing Requirements: User needs and market demands often evolve during development.
-Security Risks: Software must be robust against malicious attacks.
Cost and Time Constraints: 
-Projects often overrun budgets or miss deadlines due to poor planning or unforeseen issues.
 -> Strategies for ovecoming these challenges are effective communication, agile methodologies,prioritisation of tasks and regular reassessments of project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

(A)Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

-Prompt Engineering ia all about crafting questions or statements to get the possible responses from AI models.
-Importance: Prompt Engineering helps AI avoid giving confusing answers by making your questions clear, consise, complete, correct and specific.

(B)Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-Vague Prompt: "Tell me about clothes.:"
-Improved Prompt: "Explain the different types of clothong materials, such as cotton, wool, and sythetic fibres and discuss their advantages, disadvantages, and best uses."
-Improved prompt is more effective because: It specifies which material of clothing to discuss, it provides clear instructions on what details to include and therefore the AI will generate a more informative and relevant response instead ofa broad on generic answer.
